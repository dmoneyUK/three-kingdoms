# UX2 Refinement Decisions

This document records reviewer-approved UX2 refinement requirements that remain authoritative until merged into the primary UX2 design. It defines expected player-facing behavior and acceptance criteria only.

## 1. Local Hero Skill Controls — Single Activation Surface and Readable Adaptive Layout

### 1.1 Final player-facing result

The Local Hero Skills band beside the local Hero artwork is the single primary activation surface for Hero skills.

A player must never need to search the bottom Action Row for a second `Use <Hero Skill>` control. The Hero portrait area, Skills band, Equipment band, Hand, Guidance, and Action Row must each keep one clear responsibility:

- **Hero artwork:** local Hero identity.
- **Skills band:** Hero skills and Hero-skill activation.
- **Equipment band:** equipped cards.
- **Hand:** private playable/selectable cards.
- **Guidance:** what the player is currently expected to do.
- **Action Row:** generic continuation controls such as Confirm, Cancel, Skip, End, Play, or other non-Hero-skill decisions.

The expected mobile presentation is:

```text
┌──────────── Local Hero ────────────┬──────────── Skills ────────────┬── Equipment ──┐
│                                    │  TREACHERY  │    ENTOURAGE     │                │
│            Hero artwork            │             │                  │                │
└────────────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────┴────────────────┘
```

For Cao Cao specifically, `TREACHERY` and `ENTOURAGE` must use the available Skills width instead of remaining as narrow content-sized buttons. At 390px and 480px portrait widths, `ENTOURAGE` should remain on one line.

### 1.2 Skills band must use the available width

The Skills band must fill the horizontal space allocated to it.

Required behavior:

- The Skills container must not shrink-wrap to its text content.
- One visible skill uses the available Skills width.
- Two visible skills share the available Skills width evenly.
- Peer skill buttons for the same Hero use equal width and equal height.
- Empty horizontal space must not be left unused while a skill label is wrapping unnecessarily.
- A skill's enabled/disabled/passive state must not change its geometry.
- The Skills band must remain inside the Local Dock and must not overlap Equipment, Hand, Hero artwork, Guidance, or Action controls.

For the current Standard roster, the layout must be optimised for one- and two-skill Heroes. If a future Hero has more visible skills, use a balanced responsive grid rather than shrinking buttons below readable/touchable dimensions.

### 1.3 Skill-name typography

Skill names must be visually balanced, readable, and stable across Heroes.

Rules:

- Prefer one line whenever the complete label naturally fits.
- A single word must not be split across lines merely because the button failed to use available width.
- Multi-word names may wrap only at word boundaries.
- Maximum visible label depth is two lines.
- Never use character-by-character wrapping.
- Never use arbitrary word breaking such as `overflow-wrap: anywhere` for Hero skill names.
- Do not hyphenate Hero skill names.
- Do not truncate the skill name with ellipsis.
- Center the label horizontally and vertically.
- Keep line height compact but readable.
- Prefer giving the button more width before reducing font size.
- Peer buttons must use the same typography scale.

Examples:

```text
Correct:
┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐
│  TREACHERY  │  │  ENTOURAGE  │
└─────────────┘  └─────────────┘

Correct when a natural two-line label is required:
┌────────────────┐
│     SOWING     │
│    DISTRUST    │
└────────────────┘

Incorrect:
┌──────────┐
│ ENTOUR-  │
│   AGE    │
└──────────┘

Incorrect:
┌──────┐
│ E N  │
│ T O  │
│ U R  │
│ A G  │
│ E    │
└──────┘
```

### 1.4 Consistent button geometry

All Hero skill buttons must belong to one visual system.

Requirements:

- Minimum touch target: 44px × 44px.
- Buttons belonging to one Hero must be equal height.
- Two peer buttons must be equal width to within normal sub-pixel rendering tolerance.
- A long skill name must not make one peer button visibly larger than another.
- A short skill name must not collapse into a visibly smaller button.
- Active, available, passive, and unavailable states are communicated through state styling, not through different button sizes.
- The active skill state must be visually unmistakable.
- Disabled/passive skills remain legible and visually present without looking like an unrelated control.

### 1.5 The Skills band is the only Hero-skill activation entry point

Every **voluntary Hero skill** that the authoritative `CurrentAction` makes available must be activated from its corresponding button in the Skills band, regardless of how the capability is represented internally.

This applies to:

- Play-Phase Hero skills;
- optional phase-triggered Hero skills;
- optional damage/recovery/event-triggered Hero skills;
- explicit Hero response providers;
- Hero skills that enter a card-selection flow;
- Hero skills that enter a target-selection flow;
- Hero skills that enter a target-card selection flow.

The UI must not require the player to use a generic bottom control carrying the Hero skill name.

Examples of the required routing include, but are not limited to:

- **Cao Cao:** Treachery, Entourage.
- **Sima Yi:** Retaliation, Necromancy.
- **Ma Chao:** Horse Riding remains visible as a passive/unavailable skill when appropriate; Cavalry becomes actionable in the Skills band when authoritative capability exists.
- **Zhou Yu:** Heroic and Sowing Distrust use the same peer-button geometry.
- **Hua Tuo:** First Aid must use the Hero Skills band when it is a legal response provider; Prodigal Healer uses the same Hero-skill activation surface.
- **Zhuge Liang:** Stargazing is activated from the Hero Skills band when offered.
- **Lady Gan:** Divine Wisdom and Prudence are activated from the Hero Skills band when offered.
- **Huang Gai:** Self Sacrifice is activated from the Hero Skills band when legal.
- **Guan Yu / Zhao Yun:** transformation-response skills remain controlled from their Hero skill button rather than a duplicate generic action entry.

The complete implemented Standard Hero roster must be audited; the examples above are not an exhaustive allow-list.

### 1.6 Passive and automatic skills

A passive or automatic Hero skill must still have a stable visual home in the Skills band, but it must not create a false activation affordance.

Expected behavior:

- Passive skill: visible in the Skills band, non-actionable unless the rules explicitly create a voluntary decision.
- Automatic effect with no player decision: no duplicate Action Row button.
- Optional trigger: the existing skill button becomes enabled only while the authoritative trigger option is available.
- If the same Hero skill changes between passive/unavailable and actionable states, the button stays in the same location and changes state rather than appearing elsewhere.

### 1.7 Activation and continuation behavior

Clicking a Hero skill button may do one of two things:

1. **Immediate authoritative activation**
   - If the projected skill requires no further selection, the Skills button may submit that Hero-skill action directly.

2. **Enter an authoritative selection flow**
   - If the skill requires cards, targets, target cards, or another projected selection, clicking the Skills button activates that flow.
   - Eligible cards/targets are then highlighted or made selectable using the existing authoritative selection surfaces.
   - The bottom Action Row may show generic `Confirm` / `Cancel` after activation.
   - The Action Row must not repeat `Use <Skill Name>` as a second activation button.

A mandatory follow-up decision created *after* a Hero skill has resolved or entered a new authoritative sub-state is not considered a duplicate activation. Such follow-up decisions may use the normal decision controls appropriate to that state.

### 1.8 No duplicate Hero-skill controls in the bottom Action Row

For a Hero-skill capability that has a Skills-band control:

- Do not also render `Use <Skill>`, `<Skill>`, or another equivalent activation button in the generic action-extras area.
- Generic action controls may contain only continuation/decision actions that are not duplicate Hero-skill activation.
- Equipment providers and non-Hero providers may continue to use their appropriate existing generic response surface when they do not belong to the Hero Skills band.
- Moving a Hero skill into the Skills band must not change server legality, provider IDs, target legality, response privacy, or resolution semantics.

### 1.9 Responsive acceptance

Validate the Local Hero Skills system at minimum at:

- 320px portrait;
- 390px portrait;
- 480px portrait;
- a wide desktop/tablet viewport.

For every implemented Standard Hero:

- every metadata Hero skill appears in the Skills band;
- peer buttons have consistent geometry;
- buttons remain inside the Skills panel;
- no skill overlaps Equipment, Hero artwork, Hand, Guidance, or Action Row;
- no skill name is clipped;
- no skill name overflows its button;
- no character-by-character wrapping occurs;
- no single-word skill wraps when the available Skills width is sufficient;
- multi-word labels use no more than two natural lines;
- no horizontal document overflow is introduced;
- touch targets remain at least 44px × 44px.

Specific visual regression cases must include at least:

- Cao Cao — `Treachery` / `Entourage`;
- Zhou Yu — `Heroic` / `Sowing Distrust`;
- Ma Chao — `Horse Riding` / `Cavalry`;
- Sima Yi — `Retaliation` / `Necromancy`;
- a Hero with one skill;
- a Hero with two long multi-word skills.

### 1.10 Functional acceptance across all implemented Heroes

The audit must use the implemented Standard roster as the source set rather than testing only one representative Hero.

For each implemented Hero capability:

- If the server does not currently offer the capability, the skill button must not become falsely actionable.
- If an optional Hero capability is authoritatively offered, the corresponding Skills-band button must become the activation point.
- If the capability requires a selection, activating the button must enter the correct existing authoritative selection flow.
- If the capability is already active, the Skills button must visibly reflect that state.
- If the active local flow is cancelled or invalidated by a new action revision, the skill control must return to the correct inactive state.
- A mapped Hero skill must not also appear as a duplicate bottom action-extra control.
- Response-provider privacy must remain unchanged.
- React must not reconstruct Hero-skill legality from Hero name, phase, HP, card colour, target distance, or any other local guess when the authoritative action does not expose that option.

### 1.11 Completion criterion

This refinement is complete only when the Local Hero Skills band functions as a consistent, readable, single Hero-skill control surface across the entire implemented Standard roster.

The player should be able to look beside their Hero portrait and immediately answer:

- What skills does my Hero have?
- Which skill is available now?
- Which skill is active?
- Where do I press to use it?

They should never need to scan the bottom Action Row to discover a Hero-skill activation that should have been available beside the Hero.
