- Development handover: [HANDOVER.md](HANDOVER.md)
- Roadmap: [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)
- Official card reference: [docs/OFFICIAL_CARD_REFERENCE.md](docs/OFFICIAL_CARD_REFERENCE.md)
- Current stage: **playable four-player alpha — Standard equipment expansion with ongoing rules-engine stabilisation**

## Source of knowledge

The official **War of the Three Kingdoms (WTK) Game Card catalogue** is the primary source of truth for card names, product membership, categories and card rule meaning:

- **WTK Game Card catalogue:** https://wtkgames.com/gameCard/

For this project, always filter the catalogue to **Standard**. Endless Legends and Kingdom Wars cards are out of scope unless expansion development is explicitly enabled. When implementation behaviour, older project documentation, community translations or remembered rules conflict with the official WTK Standard catalogue, verify against the official catalogue and treat it as authoritative. The project's captured Standard reference is maintained in [`docs/OFFICIAL_CARD_REFERENCE.md`](docs/OFFICIAL_CARD_REFERENCE.md).

## Current Stage

The project has moved beyond the initial table prototype. A complete four-player match loop runs with one human and three bots. Turn ownership, ordered responses, death rewards and victory checks are working. Human card and weapon responses use a 30-second action window while bot decisions retain a 10-second window.

The current feature focus is **equipment and distance modifiers** while rules-engine extraction and regression work continues. Expansion cards and hero-specific abilities remain intentionally deferred.

The playable alpha includes:

- automatic roles and hero assignment;
- Lord bonus HP and the Zhang Fei test hero;
- Draw, Play, Discard and Ending phases;
- turn ownership, seat order, distance and attack range;
- public equipment with authoritative equip, replacement and defeat cleanup;
- ordered Attack, Dodge, Duel and global-card responses;
- Peach healing and turn-ordered Dying rescue;
- death, role reveal, Rebel defeat rewards and the Lord's Loyalist-kill penalty;
- automatic bot drawing, card play, responses, rescue and discard;
- table-based card-resolution presentation;
- event history and detailed rule-audit trail; and
- deterministic quick-test setups for card and response-chain development.

### Remaining verified Standard cards

The verified remaining cards and implementation order are maintained in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). The current verified remainder is:

1. Eight Trigrams Formation
2. Blue Steel Sword
3. Yin-Yang Swords
4. Kirin Bow
5. Borrowed Sword

The official catalogue and `docs/OFFICIAL_CARD_REFERENCE.md` take precedence over older roadmap/card lists.

### Current stage and next milestone

The shared turn and response engine is stable enough to continue the verified Standard card set. The Equipment Zone now has Armor support: Nio Shield cancels black Attack cards before Dodge or damage. The next milestone is Eight Trigrams Formation, followed by the armour-bypassing Blue Steel Sword.

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the active implementation roadmap and per-card implementation requirements.

The broad stages are:

1. Stabilise the turn loop.
2. Strengthen the general rules engine.
3. Complete the verified WTK Standard card set.
4. Complete equipment and distance modifiers.
5. Complete match rules and edge cases.
6. Add hero-specific abilities.
7. Continue product polish.

## Development

Prerequisite: Node.js `>=22.13.0`.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm test
npm run lint
```

The application uses React, TypeScript, vinext, Cloudflare Workers and D1. GitHub `main` is the authoritative source. A push to `main` runs lint and the full test suite in GitHub Actions, applies remote D1 migrations, builds the Worker and deploys it to Cloudflare.

## Contributing

1. Create a feature or bug-fix branch.
2. Keep card names and rules aligned with the official WTK Standard catalogue and `docs/OFFICIAL_CARD_REFERENCE.md`.
3. Run the tests and lint checks.
4. Open a pull request into `main`.

Do not add official card artwork, card scans, logos, frames or other YOKA visual assets without confirming usage rights. Create original visual assets for the playable site.
